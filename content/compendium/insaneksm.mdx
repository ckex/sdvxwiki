# Insane KSM and OS/US scale
* grammer check and add insaneKSM to terms and vocab and finish options in ksm tools



## What is Insane KSM?
<Callout type="warning">Insane KSM and os/us scale is meant for more advance players. At minimum you should be at least 18 VF, but recommended to be closer to 19 VF</Callout>

発狂KSM or Insane KSM is a term derived from Insane BMS in BMS. Essiently, these
are community created charts that are made to be ridiculously hard with no
restrictions. These charts go past the 1-20 scale and much further. Most charts
start at about 18 difficulty with a lot being about or above 20.

Insane KSM is known for its often unfair and difficult patterns. This is mainly
because Insane KSM charts have no restrictions for what they are allowed to do.
Normallly, There are certain "illegal" patterns that are either really hard,
unfair, or generally not acceptable. In Insane KSM, these rules don't apply as
anything goes. Some charts are even designed with the intention of keyboard play.

For more examples of illegal patterns, see [Illegal Patterns](/terminology/patterns#illegal)

Examples of charts from Insane KSM:
- [ホーリーサンバランド or Holy Samba Master](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XW0piABYec) from `KUOC NF2018 PilgrimageR` played by adamyes. This is the most popular Insane KSM chart.
- [N∅∅sphere\[TP2\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-lfR2Lh9cQ&feature=youtu.be) from `MG's Masquerade 2nd Season`. Probably the best showcase of high level Insane KSM. Illegals, chordstreams, fast jacks, weird tech, etc.
- [For MuscleBuilders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD2_wUIhVjA) from `Journey of KANSHA`. Also a very well known Insane KSM chart. 
- [おかえりなさいのメロディーを](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8BLQiRBKYE) from `KUOC NF2018 PilgrimageR` played by adamyes. Known for handtrip at 1:20
- [Finixe\[reminiscence\] ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=la5NngNR7ek)from `Effectors Challenge 4`. Fast, difficult jumpstreams.
- [銀の風\[TP\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzFo1FJOHAc) from `MG's Masquerade 2nd Season`. Personal favorite. Known for Hard Chordstreams into extremely fast streams at 1:05

Insane KSM charts come out in packs or packages. These are a collection of charts made by a group. Some packs have themes or "boss charts" with them.

Unfortunately, the Insane KSM charting scene is not very active, and new charts or packs are rarely released. The os/us table also rarely gets updated.

#### So why should I play Insane KSM?
The main idea on why people play it is that if you are able to master these
unfair and difficult patterns, you should be able to play everything in the base
game with ease. Essiently, Insane KSM can be for people who want to push their
skill ceiling higher than the base game allows.

It can also be for people who feel like they have run out of charts to play in
their skill level. If you feel like you are just playing the same things over
and over, it might be nice to try new charts.

Also, not all charts are bad, unfair, or overly difficult. There are **a lot** of
charts in these packs, with most of them just being normal charts people made. A
good amount of charts do not have illegals and act as a normal Voltex chart.

### os/us Scale
Insane KSM uses a different scale than 1-20 scale present in Sound Voltex. These are the Overshoot (os) and Undershoot (us) scale. The offical table for how this translates to SDVX difficulty is this:
<div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center mt-5">
|Level| os/us |
|:-:|:-:|
|1-16| us1-16~ |
|17| us17-, us17, us17+ |
|18| us18-, us18, us18+ |
|19| os0-2~ |
|20| os3~ |
|20+| os4-16 |
</div>

This is the table that is shown in the [excel sheet for Insane KSM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13KWwfk0_gyNdVad-8Bhy7F1r2mYRSykh9vC0qx6fSkM/edit?gid=1404127008#gid=1404127008). These are not exacts though, only estimates to difficulty.

Charts are split between Normal and Unique charts. Unique charts are marked
with a `*` at the end. For example, a overshoot 3 unique would be marked as `os3*`.
Unique charts are "Charts that have gimmicks and or elements that are not suitable
for the table, but are well worth playing". 

There exist `os0**` and `us0**` charts that are even more gimmicky and individual
difference. These often have very illegal or weird patterns, focus on one very
specific skillset, or just a gimmick/joke chart.

The majority of charts from all packs don't make it onto the os/us table. Only a
select few from every pack get graded and make it onto the table. This doesn't
mean you shouldn't play these charts, as those can be very good charts as well.


For all the os/us charts, see the [難易度表 sheet on the Insane KSM Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13KWwfk0_gyNdVad-8Bhy7F1r2mYRSykh9vC0qx6fSkM/edit?gid=144278610#gid=144278610).

#### Undershoot or us
Undershoots are below overshoots and are easier than Overshoots. These are often charts that are good for starting out.

The us scale is from `us0-` - `us18+` with `us18+` being the hardest. After
v5.0, everything below `us18-` was removed. Unlike os, us charts are divided
into 3 groups, `-`, nothing, or `+`. These markers represent difficulty. A chart
marked at `us18-` is easier than a chart marked as `us18` or `us18+`. 

#### Overshoot or os
Overshoots are above Undershoots and are harder. This is where more of the crazy charting comes into play.

The os scale is from `os0`-`os16` with `os16` being the hardest. Most of the charts
are between `os0`-`os8`. As you go higher up, there are less charts for each
respective os. There are actaully no `os15` charts and only one `os14` and four `os16`. 


## How do I play?
To get started, you must first choose what simulator you want to use. The recommended for Insane KSM is K-Shoot Mania. This is for a few reasons:
- KSM has subfolder support. A lot of packs have multiple folders to organize their charts
- Some charts are KSM only, breaking or not working on USC
- There is a Insane KSM tool to sort your os/us clears and give you recommendations. This only works with KSM as USC stores your scores in your `maps.db`
- A lot of charts use weird camera work that was built for KSM. USC camera works differently so depending on the chart, it can make charts easier or more difficult to read depending on the camera
- KSM has effects that only work on KSM

That is to say that you can use USC if you prefer. The same advantages that USC has over KSM still apply. Just for Insane KSM, there is more of a reason to use KSM over USC.

Once you decide what simulator you want to use you can now download packs.

### Downloading charts
If you only care about Overshoot charts, you can download all Overshoot charts from [this Google Drive.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GQlJTYWjgXSJoA4SwbcASRk00xKXVAqw)
This drive has every single `os0` - `os16` chart that is offically on the v5.0 sheet. It does not include all the extra charts from these packs. This also works as a way to sort Overshoot charts by difficulty.

If you want all the extra charts from the packs, you can download [leviern 18.8 GB drive of packs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m1vHqD7Lu3c4B93qoCv8eF7MQF5MedCR/view?usp=sharing).
This covers most packs up till 1/26/2022 or `Challenging Charts for Competitive Players vol.1`. 
For the rest of the packs, you have to download them individually in the [パッケージ集 sheet of the Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13KWwfk0_gyNdVad-8Bhy7F1r2mYRSykh9vC0qx6fSkM/edit?gid=482142057#gid=482142057).


### Insane KSM Tool
If you play on KSM, there is a tool that you can use to sort your os/us clears,
give recommendations for what to play, a "level" system that works as a way of
tracking your skill, and create .fav based on all the os files you have. This
tool is in Japanese but I will roughly translate it here.

You can download this [here](https://ux.getuploader.com/ksmscoretool/download/5). Press the small `ダウンロード` button and then `Download Now`.

Extract this folder to where you want and run `KSM Score Tool.exe`. If it is
your first time running it, you will have to point it to your scores. This will
be `/your KSM folder/score/PLAYER/`. If you have renamed your profile in KSM,
PLAYER will be replaced with what you named yourself. It will then process all your scores.

After it's finish you will be brought to the main screen which displays your profile. To view more, click `メニュー` at the top left.

<div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center mt-5">

</div>

- `ムイページ`. My Page. The default page that shows your Name, Recommend, Class, and License 
- `全スコアデータ`. All your score data. This doesn't work and will crash as it is in development.
- `統計`. Statistics. This will show you your stats on a specific range of difficulties. 
- `リコメンド対象`. Recommended targets. This will show you recommendations for charts you can upscore.
- `ターゲットスコア`. Target Scores. This doesn't work and will crash as it is in development.
- `favファイル生成`. .fav folder creation. This creates a .fav that organizes all the charts you have into the os/us folders for KSM. These folder are then shown in KSM. Pressing this will bring up a confirmation window in which you can press `はい` to continue.
- `License生成`. License course creations. This will create the courses for your "License". This is similar to [Skill Analyzer](/gamemodes#skill-analyzer). Pressing this will bring up a confirmation window in which you can press `はい` to continue.

At the very minimum, it is recommended to create the .fav to sort all your os/us in KSM. 

While it says this tool is "in development" it has been a while since it has gotten an update.
