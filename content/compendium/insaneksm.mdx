# Insane KSM and OS/US scale
* grammer check and add insaneKSM to terms and vocab



## What is Insane KSM?
<Callout type="warning">Insane KSM and os/us scale is meant for more advance players. At minimum you should be at least 18 VF, but recommended to be closer to 19 VF</Callout>

発狂KSM or Insane KSM is a term derived from Insane BMS in BMS. Essiently, these
are community created charts that are made to be ridiculously hard with no
restrictions. These charts go past the 1-20 scale and much further. Most charts
start at about 18 difficulty with a lot being about or above 20.

Insane KSM is known for its often unfair and difficult patterns. This is mainly
because Insane KSM charts have no restrictions for what they are allowed to do.
Normallly, There are certain "illegal" patterns that are either really hard,
unfair, or generally not acceptable. In Insane KSM, these rules don't apply as
anything goes. Some charts are even designed with the intention of keyboard play.

Unfortunately, the Insane KSM charting scene is not very active, and new charts or packs are rarely released. The OS/US table also rarely gets updated.

### os/us Scale
Insane KSM uses a different scale than 1-20 scale present in Sound Voltex. These are the Overshoot (os) and Undershoot (us) scale. The offical table for how this translates to the SDVX is this:
<div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center mt-5">
|Level| os/us |
|:-:|:-:|
|1-16| us1-16~ |
|17| us17-, us17, us17+ |
|18| us18-, us18, us18+ |
|19| os0-2~ |
|20| os3~ |
|20+| os4-16 |
</div>

This is the table that is shown in the [excel sheet for Insane KSM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13KWwfk0_gyNdVad-8Bhy7F1r2mYRSykh9vC0qx6fSkM/edit?gid=1404127008#gid=1404127008). These are not exacts though, only estimates to difficulty.
