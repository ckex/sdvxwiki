## Intro
There are currently 2 radars in the game. One on your profile and one for every chart in the game.

Each chart has its radar, as shown in the image above. Radar is made up of
6 parts. Notes, Peak, Tsunami, Tricky, Hand Trip, One Hand. Each one of these
represent different skills. The higher the bar is toward that skill, the more of
that skill is prevalent in the chart.

## Radar types

### Notes
Notes are measured by how many notes there are compared to how long the song is.
A song with a bunch of notes will be higher, while a song with a bunch of lasers
or one-hand patterns will be less.

### Peak
The peak density of notes. If there is a chart with one section have a really
dense note section, this will be higher.

### Tsumami
This represents lasers. The more lasers, the higher this will be on the radar.
For mainly laser charts, you can tell by the Tsunami section in the radar being
super lopsided.

### One Hand
Self explanatory. Measure of how many notes need to be hit with one hand.
Meaning you are controlling a laser with one hand and notes on the other.

For examples, see [One-hand in charting patterns](/terminology/patterns#one-hand)

### Hand Trip
How many notes need to be hit on the other side of the controller. For
example, cross-handing a laser, hitting BT-A or BT-B with your right hand,
and hitting BT-C or BT-D with your left hand. 

For examples, see [Hand-trip in charting patterns](/terminology/patterns#hand-trip)

### Tricky
Catch all for anything else not mentioned. This is generally speed changes, jacks,
spins, gimmicks, etc.

## Profile radar
There is also a profile radar, only viewable when you card in and look at your
profile, and at the end of the credit screen. This is a separate system
similar to VF. It takes your best 50 of each category and measures that.

Note that this system and the equation it uses are not well known. The main
thing that is known about it is that it uses [EX-Score](http://localhost:3000/compendium/exscore) and not normal score.
