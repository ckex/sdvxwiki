## Intro
Schedule maintenance happens every day. During this downtime, you will not be able to access the E-Amusement website. Meaning, you won't be able to open Konasute コナステ during these times.

There are two types of maintenance.

## Maintenance
### Regular Maintenance
Here is the downtime translated to mainly America timezones. For daylight savings, add an hour.
<div className="text-center mt-2">
**Every day, from 5 AM to 7 AM JST**
</div>
<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-2">
 |Timezone|Downtime|
 |:-:|:-:|
 |EST|3 PM - 5 PM|
 |CST|2 PM - 4 PM|
 |MST|1 PM - 3 PM|
 |PST|12 PM - 2 PM|
 |CET|8 PM - 10 PM|
</div>

If you are in Japan or the Asian region, excluding Saturday and Sunday, you
will not be able to play on the cabinets at these times. American cabs in the US
region are excluded from this, meaning you can still play while maintenance is
happening.

### Extended Maintenance
<div className="text-center mt-2">
**Third Tuesday of the month, from 2 AM to 7 AM JST**
</div>
<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-2">
 |Timezone|Downtime|

 |EST|12 PM - 5 PM|
 |CST|11 AM - 4 PM|
 |MST|10 AM - 3 PM|
 |PST|9 AM - 2 PM|
 |CET|5 PM - 10 PM|

This maintenance applies to all regions for the Arcade and Konasute. Meaning, you
won't be able to play during these times even at the arcade.

The only exception to this maintenance is if it falls on a national holiday in
Japan, which it gets moved to the next day. 

## Notes
If you are playing Konasute and want to play during maintenance hours, you can
open the game/launcher before the maintenance happens and play. You will not be
kicked out once maintenance happens. Your scores will be submitted as normal. If you
close the game or your game crashes, you will not be able to re-launch the game.

It is recommended to follow the [Twitter bot](https://x.com/eamuse_schedule) that
will tweet out warnings and times for extended maintenance and normal maintenance.
It also tweets when the servers come back online.
