## Intro
This page is for information about the various gauge types available in SDVX. The 2 main gauge types are EFFECTIVE RATE and EXCESSIVE RATE which are available during normal play. The other gauge types are only available in certain gamemodes or unlock systems.

## EFFECTIVE RATE
Starts at 0% and requires completing the chart at 70% or greater to clear.

Also referred to as normal gauge.

## EXCESSIVE RATE
Starts at 100% and requires completing the chart without reaching 0% to clear.

Also referred to as hard gauge.

## PERMISSIVE RATE
Starts at 100% and requires completing the chart without reaching 0% to clear. Notably easier than EXCESSIVE RATE as it carries over across 3 charts. The charts played with this gauge will not be granted a clear medal.

Only available during [SKILL ANALYZER](/compendium/gamemodes#skill-analyzer).

## DIVINE RATE
Starts at 100% and requires completing the chart without reaching 0% to clear. Notable for only increasing on S-CRITICALs and decreasing on NEARs.

Only available during [SKILL ANALYZER](/compendium/gamemodes#skill-analyzer).

## HEXATIVE RATE
Starts at 100% and requires completing the chart without reaching 0% to clear. Difficulty of this gauge can be adjusted by selecting a [HEXA RANK](/compendium/unlocks#hexadiver) which ranges from 1-5. Rank 3 is only slightly easier than EXCESSIVE RATE with 4 and 5 being more difficult.

Only available during [HEXA DIVER](/compendium/unlocks#hexadiver).

## Alternative Rate System (ARS)
An option used in combination with EXCESSIVE RATE or HEXATIVE RATE under certain conditions. Prevents failing out from a chart by switching to EFFECTIVE RATE upon reaching 0%. The gauge amount given in this scenario will be the same as if you played with EFFECTIVE RATE to begin with.

## Gain/Loss Breakdown

- Chips are BT and FX chip objects
- Hold and laser objects have ticks which are judged individually
- **T**: Unknown but fixed value regardless of chart
- **n**: Varies per chart: `(total chain amount) + (# of chips and slams) * 3`
- **H**: [HEXA RANK](/compendium/unlocks#hexadiver)
