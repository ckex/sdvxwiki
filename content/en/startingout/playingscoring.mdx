# Score, Grades, and Reading Score

## Score
<Callout>
This page is talking about Normal Score. To see more on Ex-Score, see the [Ex-Score page.](/compendium/exscore)
</Callout>
You can get any score between `0`-`10,000,000`. A score of `10,000,000` would mean you got a [PUC](/terminology/termsandvocab#pucperfect-ultimate-chainperfect) or a perfect. This is the highest score obtainable.

Your score is only calulated with Crits, Nears, and Errors. Nears are worth half the points of a Crit. Errors are worth nothing.

Score is not in any way tied to a clear. It is possible to not clear with a S or clear with a D. Of course, these are extremes. 

## Grades
Your score is directly tied to the grade you get. For example, anything above 9,900,000 is an S. Here are all the grades you can get and what the score requirement is.
<br/>
<div className="flex items-center justify-center">
   | Grade |  Score  |
   |:-:|:-:| 
   |  S  | > 9,900,000 |
   | AAA+ | 9,899,999 - 9,800,000| 
   | AAA | 9,799,999 - 9,700,000|
   | AA+ | 9,699,999 - 9,500,000|
   | AA | 9,499,999 - 9,300,000|
   | A+ | 9,299,999 - 9,000,000|
   | A | 8,999,999 - 8,700,000|
   | B | 8,699,999 - 7,500,000|
   | C | 7,499,999 - 6,500,000|
   | D | < 6,500,000| 
</div>

Getting a higher grade is a massive boost in volforce. If you improve your
`9,800,000` to a `9,899,999` it will give you much less volforce then going from
`9,899,999` to `9,990,000`. This is because the 989x-990x is going from a AAA+ to a
S which is worth more. [A more detailed guide on how volforce works](/compendium/volforce#volforce)

## How do I know if my score is good or bad?

If you were playing a chart and didn't give up half way, you shouldn't get
a score below` 9,000,000` (in the beginning you might as you are playing charts
with not a lot of chain, so the notes are worth more). This is mostly because
the only thing that docks you points using normal score is nears and errors.

If you are getting scores below `9,000,000` and you are playing level 12+, you
might want to change something to try and hit more accuracy. You also might be
playing something too hard for you.

S is usually the end goal for charts as you have generally got the most volforce
you can get. Of course UC and PUC will give more, but those can be much
more difficult to get then a S.

When starting, you might not really understand what a good score vs bad score
and that generally takes time for you to figure out.
