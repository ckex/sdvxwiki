## General Patterns

### Triple Stairs
<Image src="/guides/specific-pattern-cheese/triples.png"/>

For patterns like this, you can chord the notes to make it easier.
<Image src="/guides/specific-pattern-cheese/chordtriple.png"/>
<em className="flex justify-center">Pattern on the left, how to play on the right.</em>

It is important to note that it is better to chord it with outwards instead of inwards. Meaning, you should chord the last 2 notes not the first 2. For a deeper explaination see [Mini Note.](https://note.com/mini208/n/n3d77e9743e68)

A common example might be [I MXM 20](https://sdvx.in/04/04238m.htm), where you can do this.

<p className="text-lg font-bold">Example Charts</p>
- [BAYONEX MXM 19](https://sdvx.in/06/06102m.htm) Measures 130-132
- [Absolute Domination MXM 19](https://sdvx.in/04/04324m.htm) Measures 50-51
- [Xroniàl Xéro MXM 19](https://sdvx.in/05/05239m.htm) Measures 80-87


### Spaced Out Chords
<Image src="/guides/specific-pattern-cheese/space_chords.png"/>
Chords spaced out like these you can press all BT and FX buttons. There is no error for pressing the wrong button.

<p className="text-lg font-bold">Example Charts</p>
- [BEAST BASS BOMB MXM 18](https://sdvx.in/04/04187m.htm) Measures 1-11
- [Fire Storm MXM 18](https://sdvx.in/03/03167e.htm) Measures 1-6

### Cross Lasers

These lasers can be simplifed to a simple in and out motion like this.

<p className="text-lg font-bold">Example Charts</p>
- [XROSS INFECTION GRV 19](https://sdvx.in/02/02125m.htm) Measures 43, 45, 47-48, 81-82
- [MAYHEM MXM 20](https://sdvx.in/05/05283m.htm) Measures 273-280
- [Everlasting Message GRV 19](https://sdvx.in/03/03075m.htm) Measures 80-81, 108-109

### Wiggle Lasers
Certain Curve Wiggles can be cheesed by just going one direction on the knob. You can't go too fast or too slow with the knob. Generally, you want to go slower than how you would normally turn it.

#### Crawl Out Immortal Laser
<Image src="/guides/specific-pattern-cheese/crawl_out_immortal_wiggle.png"/>
<em className="flex justify-center">[Crawl Out Immortal MXM 18](https://sdvx.in/06/06454m.htm)</em>
This one speed doesn't really matter and is more lenient

### Wiggleing
For every single laser in the game, you can "wiggle" your way through them. This involves rapidly moving the knob from left to right like you are doing a [Hynea](/terminology/patterns#hyena). 
This works because how the laser engines works. There is a lot of "leeway" when
it comes to laser and you are able to go off the lasers for a bit before it
counts as a error. There is also a "Locked On" mechanism that makes it harder
for your laser to go off the laser after it is locked in. If you rapidly go back
and forth, you will lock on to the laser, go off, turn back and lock back onto the laser, and repeat. 

## Specific Charts

### Xronièr MXM 20 Intro and Outro Cheese
<Image src="/guides/specific-pattern-cheese/xronier.png"/>
This pattern can be simplifed in two ways. For a UC with a good amount of nears, you can do this.
<Image src="/guides/specific-pattern-cheese/xronier_uc_cheese.png"/>
The number of nears you get will depend on when you are timing your hits, but even if you are perfect, you will guarantee a near on the fx most likely.
#### Full Crit
For a full crit method, you can do this.

### Everlasting Message GRV 19 Chord Cheese
<Image src="/guides/specific-pattern-cheese/everlastingmessage_chord.png"/>

If it makes it easier to read, you can hit the [Everlasting Message GRV 19](https://sdvx.in/03/03075m.htm) FX chords like this.
