## Intro
By nature, simulators do not offer the official experience but are free to play and allow you to play both [converts](/terminology/termsandvocab#convert) and user-created charts (referred to as [customs](/terminology/termsandvocab#custom)).

There are two SDVX simulators: Unnamed SDVX clone (USC) and K-Shoot MANIA (KSM). Both simulators can play the same charts but are overall much different in terms of features.

## Unnamed SDVX clone (USC)

<Image src="/setup/simulators/usc_preview.png" alt="usc preview" />

[Home page](https://github.com/Drewol/unnamed-sdvx-clone)

### Pros
- [ARS/Backup Gauge support](/gauge-options#alternative-rate-system-ars)
- Excellent performance
- More intuitive song sorting and filtering
- Online leaderboards (for converts only)
- Playable on Windows/macOS/Linux
- Portrait gameplay support
- Practice mode
- Replay system

### Cons
- Camera effects may not behave properly
- Effects may not sound as intended
- Lasers are not accurate

### Setup

[Download Page](https://github.com/Drewol/unnamed-sdvx-clone/releases/)

Extract the contents to a folder on your computer and run `usc-game.exe` inside. Any charts that you download (see [here](#charts) for where to find them) should be placed in the `songs` folder that is created upon running the game for the first time.

Before you start playing, there are settings you should adjust:

<Image src="/setup/simulators/usc_settings_1.png" alt="usc settings 1" />

In the `Input` tab, set `Button input mode` and `Laser input mode` to the input device you are using. Then, click the buttons above to modify your bindings.
<br/>

In the `Game` tab, set `Speed mod type` to `MMod` and adjust `ModSpeed`. For new players, any speed between 300-400 is recommended.
<br/>

In the `Skin` tab you can enable any skins you have installed and adjust any skin-specific settings.

Once that's all done, you're ready to play! Here are some keybinds that you may find useful:
  - During song select:
    - `Tab` to search for songs
    - `F2` to select a random song
    - `FX-L` to filter by folder, press `START` while this menu is open to filter by level
    - `FX-L + FX-R` to open the game settings menu
    - `BT-B + BT-C` to open the collections menu
  - `F5` during gameplay to quickly restart
  - `F12` during results to take a screenshot

### Skins

Besides the default skin, those listed below are the only up-to-date skins that should be used.

For installing skins, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hqxcwzge06I). Even though the video is for Nightfall specifically, the process is the same for any other skin.

| Name | Description | Download | Showcase |
|--|--|--|--|
| Nightfall | A minimal but highly customizable skin that includes many features not available in the base game. | [Link](https://github.com/Hoshikara/Nightfall) | [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVazaZcb15A) |

## K-Shoot MANIA (KSM)

<Image src="/setup/simulators/ksm_preview.png" alt="ksm preview" />

[Home page](https://www.kshootmania.com/en/)

### Pros
- Camera and sound effects work as intended
- Online leaderboards (for custom charts only)

### Cons
- Poor performance
- Lasers are not accurate (but still arguably better than USC)
- Limited resolution options
- No portrait gameplay support
- No song search
- Windows only

### Setup

[Download Page](https://www.kshootmania.com/en/download.html)

Extract the contents to a folder on your computer and run `kshootmania.exe` inside. Any charts that you download (see [here](#charts) for where to find them) should be placed in the `songs` folder.

Before you start playing, enter `OPTION` and adjust these settings:

<Image src="/setup/simulators/ksm_settings_1.png" alt="ksm settings 1" />

In `DISPLAY / SOUND` settings:
- Set the `DISPLAY LANGUAGE` accordingly
- Set `BG (WHILE PLAYING)` to `Hide` to improve gameplay FPS
- Set `HIDE "ALL" FOLDER` to `On` to improve song select performance
<br/>

<Image src="/setup/simulators/ksm_settings_2.png" alt="ksm settings 2" />

In `INPUT / JUDGEMENT` settings:
- Set `INPUT TYPE OF LASER OBJECT` to `Hold key` if you are playing on keyboard, or see [this guide](/guides/ksm-controller-setup) if you are playing with a controller
- Make sure `ASSIST TICK` is set to `On`; this setting is bugged and works the opposite way (on is off and off is on)

Return to the title screen and select `START`. Note that you will be prompted to sign in to the internet ranking system every time.
<br/>

Hold down `BT-D` to bring up the `Hispeed` menu and then press your left or right arrow key to switch to a fixed number setting. For new players, any speed between 300-400 is recommended.

Once that's all done, you're ready to play! Here are some keybinds that you may find useful:
  - During song select:
    - `FX-L + FX-R` to toggle between alphabetical and level sort
    - `FX-L` or `FX-R` to jump to the next or previous letter or level in the current folder
    - Any `BT` for various gameplay settings
    - Any `BT` and `FX-L` or `FX-R` to jump to the start or end of the current folder

    - Hold `START` to add or remove favorites
  - Any 3 `BT` and `START` to quickly exit gameplay

More skins can be found at the [KSM subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/kshootmania/wiki/skins) but their download links may be dead.

To install a skin, make sure KSM is closed and follow these steps within your KSM folder:
  1. Make a backup of your `imgs` and `se` folders
  2. Extract in the `imgs` and `se` folders the skin provides and accept all replacements
  3. Delete your `cache` folder

## Which one should I play?

After reviewing the pros and cons of each simulator, you might be thinking "why would anyone play KSM?". For those that do choose to play KSM over USC, they believe the gameplay engine simply feels better and in the end that's what matters. However, these tend to be either more experienced players that can pick up on the differences or older players who are simply too used to KSM after playing it for so long.

For newer players, it is recommended to play USC for all the features it offers over KSM. But don't forget these simulators are free to play, so it doesn't hurt to try both and see which one you prefer.

For those looking to play custom charts (namely [Insane KSM](/compendium/insaneksm)), it is recommended to play KSM. Even though custom charts can also be played in USC, nearly all of them are created with the camera and effects of KSM in mind.

## Charts

To find custom made charts, you can head to [ksm.dev](https://ksm.dev/). While they can definitely vary in quality, and a lot of them are higher level charts, it can be a good way of finding charts for songs you like.

You can also play converts. Older charts (from SDVX 1-5) can be found [here](https://gitlab.magiruuvelvet.gdn/magiruuvelvet/sdvx-charts/) and for recent charts (from SDVX 6), you can find them in [this Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S8gj7-waR4o4o7gU_NZtR3VmsD8UY4ho).

After downloading a chart, extract and place the folder in the songs folder. For example, `/USC/songs` is where I would put my songs. Do not remove the song folder from the folder that it comes in as songs are organized by the game version that they belong to.

You can also organize charts in folders. For example if you want all your downloaded charts in one folder, you can create a folder and place it in there. You can then sort by this folder in both USC and KSM.
USC doesn't support multi folder organization, i.e. for `/songs/NauticaDownloads/2024` USC wouldn't recognize the `2024` folder, but it can still see all the songs in that folder. KSM would recognize the `2024` folder and show it in game.
