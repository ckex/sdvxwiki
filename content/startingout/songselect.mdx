# Song Select


## Song select
When starting the game, you will be brought to song selection. Here you select
the chart you want to play. You can move through the songs or folders with the
VOL-R knob (Right). Change the difficulty with the `VOL-L` knob. Pressing Start
will select what you are hovering. 

Pressing `FX-L` (left) will close the current open folder. Pressing `FX-R` (right)
will open the sorting menu. Here is a general translation of what everything
means.

<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-3">
 <img src='/startingout/Sort.png' width="400"/>
</div>

When hovering over a song, you can press `0` to favorite it. This will add it to a separate folder. You can have up to 50 songs favorited.

Pressing `8` while on this screen will open the Rival leaderboard and Location/National best Leaderboard. 

Pressing `3` will choose a random chart in the folder selected.

Holding `FX-L/R` and scrolling will scroll faster. 

If in premium time, Pressing all the BT buttons will give you the option to leave premium time.
