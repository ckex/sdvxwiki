# Song Select

## Song select
When starting the game, you will be brought to song selection. Song selection is where you select the chart you would like to play.

Move vertically through the charts with `VOL-R` knob. Change difficulty of the chart with `VOL-L`. Pressing chart will select the song you are hovering.

Here you select


the chart you want to play. You can move through the songs or folders with the
VOL-R knob (Right). Change the difficulty with the `VOL-L` knob. Pressing Start
will select what you are hovering. 

Pressing `FX-L` (left) will close the current open folder. Pressing `FX-R` (right)
will open the sorting menu. Here is a general translation of what everything
means.

</div>

When hovering over a song, you can press `0` to favorite it. This will add it to a separate folder. You can have up to 50 songs favorited.

Pressing `8` while on this screen will open the Rival leaderboard and Location/National best Leaderboard. 

Pressing `3` will choose a random chart in the folder selected.

Holding `FX-L/R` and scrolling will scroll faster. 

If in premium time, Pressing all the BT buttons will give you the option to leave premium time.

## Matching
If you are not in a premium time or using konasute, after selecting a song you
will start matching. This will automatically happen. If you don't want to
match/don't care you can skip it by pressing both of the fx buttons at the same
time.

## While in song
When you load into a song, you will be greeted with something that looks like this. While this looks like a lot, here is all the important stuff

<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-3">
 <img src='/startingout/songselect/ingame.jpg' width="400"/>
</div>

1. **Title, Cover, and difficulty of song:** Bar under the title is progress bar.
   Next to the cover it will also show what current track you are on if you are
   not on premium time.
2. **Current BPM and current lane speed:** If there is a BPM change, you will see
   what it is changing to and also what your lane speed is changing to here. If
   you are using an offset of any kind, it will also show that right under the
   lane speed where 8.60 in red currently is. To change lane speed while in the
   game, hold start and move the knob, pressing start twice and then holding
   will allow for finer control.
3. **Your profile data:** Shows current crew member, appeal card, rank, dan,
   volforce, and other things depending on what you have.
4. **Shows current challenge and if you have auto quick retry on:** Only appears on
   premium time or Konasute. Pressing `00` on the numpad will enable auto quick
   retry, making it so that the moment you fail out, you will automatically
   retry.
5. **Current score, ex score, and highest chain you have had:** If you are using
   ex-score, this will look slightly different. 
6. **Life Gauge:** This is you life bar. It might look different depending on what your
   settings are and how good you are doing.
