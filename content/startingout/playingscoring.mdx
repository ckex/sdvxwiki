### What does your score mean?
<Callout>
   This is Normal Score, not EX-Score.
</Callout>

You can get a score between 0-10,000,000. A score of 10,000,000 means you got a perfect or PUC. This means you didn't hit any nears or errors. That is the highest score obtainable.

Your score is directly tied to the grade you get. For example, anything above 9,900,000 is an S. Here are all the grades you can get and what the score requirement is.
<br/>
<div className="flex items-center justify-center">
   | Grade |  Score  |
   |:-:|:-:| 
   |  S  | > 9,900,000 |
   | AAA+ | 9,899,999 - 9,800,000| 
   | AAA | 9,799,999 - 9,700,000|
   | AA+ | 9,699,999 - 9,500,000|
   | AA | 9,499,999 - 9,300,000|
   | A+ | 9,299,999 - 9,000,000|
   | A | 8,999,999 - 8,700,000|
   | B | 8,699,999 - 7,500,000|
   | C | 7,499,999 - 6,500,000|
   | D | < 6,500,000| 
</div>

Getting a higher grade is a massive boost in volforce. If you improve your
9,800,000 to a 9,899,999 it will give you much less volforce then going from
9,899,999 to 9,990,000. This is because the 989x-990x is going from a AAA+ to a
S which is worth more. [A more detailed guide on how volforce works](/compendium/volforce#volforce)

The score is not in any way tied to a clear. It is possible to not clear with a
S or clear with a D. Of course, these are extremes. 

#### Bonus notes
When starting, you might not really understand what a good score vs bad score
and that generally takes time for you to figure out. Here are some general ideas
when it comes to score though.

If you were playing a chart and didn't give up half way, you shouldn't get
a score below 9,000,000 (in the beginning you might as you are playing charts
with not a lot of notes, so the notes are worth more). This is mostly because
the only thing that docks you points using normal score is nears and errors.

If you are getting scores below 9,000,000 and you are playing level 12+, you
might want to change something to try and hit more accuracy. You also might be
playing something too hard for you.

S is usually the end goal for charts as you have generally got the most volforce
you can get. Of course UC and PUC will give more, but those can be much much
more difficult to get then a S.
