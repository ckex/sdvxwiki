## Song Select

When starting the game, you will be brought to song selection. Here you select
the chart you want to play. You can move through the songs or folders with the
VOL-R knob (Right). Change the difficulty with the `VOL-L` knob. Pressing Start
will select what you are hovering. 

Pressing `FX-L` (left) will close the current open folder. Pressing `FX-R` (right)
will open the sorting menu. Here is a general translation of what everything
means.

<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-3">
 <img src='/startingout/Sort.png' width="400"/>
</div>

When hovering over a song, you can press `0` to favorite it. This will add it to a separate folder. You can have up to 50 songs favorited.

Pressing `8` while on this screen will open the Rival leaderboard and Location/National best Leaderboard. 

Pressing `3` will choose a random chart in the folder selected.

Holding `FX-L/R` and scrolling will scroll faster. 

If in premium time, Pressing all the BT buttons will give you the option to leave premium time.

## Options
While on the song select screen, pressing `FX-L` and `FX-R` will bring up the
options menu. On Valkyrie cabs, you can also access it on the touch screen. This
guide will go over all the options, what they do, and recommended settings.

### Lane Speed
<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-3">
![lanespeed](/startingout/LaneSpeed.png)
</div>

This is the first setting that appears when opening. Using the right knob you
can adjust it from 1 to 10. When starting, you will most likely hover around
2-4. As your reading skill gets better you will generally start to increase this
to make things easier to read. In general, 
<div className="text-center mt-2">
The higher the lane speed = The fewer notes on the screen = The easier it is to read.
</div>
However, you don't want to increase it to the point where you are reacting and not reading. 

Pressing `Numpad 6` will lock your lane speed so that it will default set it to whatever it is set
to. 

Lane speed is very much a preference. Some people can read 9+ lane speed while
others stay at 6-8. How fast you can read is dependent on a lot of different
things. 

A lot of people confuse lane speed with how fast the chart is. Increasing your
lane speed doesn't increase the speed of the chart, just changes how long notes
are on screen. Here is an example of how lane speed affects charts.

<video className="mt-3" playslnline="true" muted loop controls>

</video>
From left to right, [JiminP 1.00 Lane Speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjY1itUxA0s), [DDX 6.90 Lane Speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HewBZrjtuDU), and [Mini 9.50 Lane Speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLjAC0NUJAg)

Even though they look different, They are playing the same chart. It isn't "faster" or "slower". Just looks different

### Offset
<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-3">
![offset](/startingout/Offset.png)
</div>

There are 2 offsets. Draw and Judge. Draw is visual offset and Judge is audio.
Draw moves the judgment line either up (+) or down (-). It doesn't do this
visually, the judgment line will still look like it's in the same spot but it has moved.
Judge adds offset to the music. If you are on a Valkyrie Cabinet, pressing
the offset number on the touchscreen will change it to ms. Or you can press the following numpad to change the offset:

1. `8`: Judge +
2. `2`: Judge -
3. `9`: Draw +
4. `3`: Draw -

If you are hitting late, moving to the negative may help. If you are hitting
early, moving to the positive may help. 

Your offset can sometimes change day-to-day setup-to-setup. 

An important thing to note is that a lot of times it isn't your offset but
rather your lane speed/reading ability. If you notice you are hitting a lot of
lates or earlies, you might be playing a chart that is difficult for you to read
or your lane speed is wrong. Generally the difference between your offset and base offset shouldn't be more than 5.

If you are having trouble finding your offset [here is JiminP
guide.](https://r-g.kr/article/sync)

### Early Late adjustment
<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-3">
![earlylate](/startingout/Earlylate.png)
</div>

The next 3 are adjustments to the early late that show up when you press something off-timing. 
<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-3">
![earlyexample](/startingout/Earlyexample.png)
</div>
The first one adjusts when the early/late shows up. (Pictured above) Critical will make it so that every time you hit a crit or below it will show up. Near will make it so only nears and below it will show up. Off means it never shows up.

<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-3">
![msexample](/startingout/msexmaple.png)
</div>
The second one adjusts when the ms shows up. (Pictured above) All will show it for everything, even S-Crit. Note that if you hit a S-Crit, it will be grey. Critical will make it so that every time you hit a Crit or below it will show up. Near will make it so only Nears and below it will show up. Off means it never shows up.

The final option adjust where they show up. 

In general, it is a good idea to have one of them only show up for nears and the
other show up for all or just crits. That way you know if you hit a near.

### S-Critical
<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-3">
![SCrit](/startingout/SCrit.png)
</div>

This adds an extra judgment that is stricter than Crit. This does not affect normal scoring. 

Note that if you are using light start this will not be accessible. This does not matter for Konasute. In general, it is recommended to always have this on if you can.

### Lane preview
<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-3">
![preview](/startingout/Preview.png)
</div>
Here you can preview the changes you just made. It will play a simple chart with a simple song where you can see your lane speed, offsets, and early/late adjustments. It is recommend using this to figure out what you like.

### System Voice
<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-3">
![systemvoice](/startingout/SystemVoice.png)
</div>

You can choose to disable or enable the voice from your navigator that plays around the menus. For example, the voice that plays when you complete a chart.

### Show SDVX Konasute/Arcade scores
<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-3">
  ![showscores](/startingout/ShowScores.png)
</div>

If you play on Konasute, you can choose to see your Konasute (or arcade if you
are playing Konasute) scores. Note that Volforce is separate and that you don't
have that score unless you got it at an arcade. For example, if you are rivaled
with someone on arcade, they will only see your arcade scores.

You can tell which scores are from Konasute or Arcade by if this light at the
top is lit.

<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-3">
  ![showkonasutescore](/startingout/ShowKonasuteScores.png)
</div>
Here it shows that this score was from the arcade because the Arcade is lit up.

### Valkyrie Effect
<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-3">
  ![valkyrieeffect](/startingout/ValkyrieEffect.png)
</div>

This changes how the lasers look. Enabling it adds a bit more effect to lasers.
Some people like this off. If you would like to see the difference, [Here is a
Side-by-Side by Neardayo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnpcD08o4t8)

### Early Late Color
<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-3">
  ![earlylateflip](/startingout/Earlylateflip.png)
</div>

This flips the early and late colors. Normally, Late are blue and Early is pink/red. This flips them. 

### Laser Colors
<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-3">
  ![lasercolors](/startingout/lasercolors.png)
</div>

These change the laser colors. The first one is the left laser and the second one is the right laser. Most people don't change these. Although notably Mini has his left laser (Normally blue) as green.

### Display Brightness
<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-3">
  ![displaybrightness](/startingout/displaybrightness.png)
</div>

This is how bright the background is. If you want a good example, look at the Lane Speed video above. Mini plays on a brighter background compared to JiminP and DDX.

### Normal Scoring and Ex Scoring
<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-3">
![normalscoreexscore](/startingout/normalscoreexscore.png)
</div>

This switches between Normal Scoring and EX Scoring. Normal Scoring is the score
that is graded and used for Volforce. It has a max of 10,000,000 on every chart
and is based on Crit, Nears, and errors. EX Scoring is based on S-Crits, Crits,
Nears, and Errors. It is calculated differently with every S-Crit worth 5
points, Crit worth 4, Near worth 2, and Error worth 0. Every chart has a
different max score. 

Even if you use EX-score, your normal score is still calulated and same vice
versa (as long as you have s-crits enabled). You can see your EX-Score right
under your score on any chart.

If you are just starting, it is recommened to keep Normal Scoring.

### Random and Mirror
<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-3">
  ![randommirror](/startingout/RandomMirror.png)
</div>

This changes how the chart is.
- Mirror flips the chart. For example a chart that is normally a 1-2-3-4 staircase is now a 4-3-2-1 staircase.
- Random randomizes the lanes the notes come down. For example, a 1-2-3-4 staircase now can become 3-2-4-1.
- S-Random completely randomizes the notes as well, so any note can be anything

<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-3">
  ![randommirrorexample](/startingout/RandomMirrorExamples.png)
</div>
In general, Mirror is the only useable option. Random and S-Ran often make charts have illegal patterns.

### Effective/Excessive Clear
<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-3">
![ClearType](/startingout/ClearType.png)
</div>

These are the clear type options.

- **Effective Rate:** Start at 0% and work up to above 70% gauge to clear
- **Excessive Rate:** Start at 100% and survive the whole chart without it dropping to 0 to clear. Errors take more off the gauge and are harder to build up compared to Effective.
- **Excessive + ARS:** Starts Excessive Rate and if you fail out of Excessive, then go to Effective. Your Effective Gauge is still calculated as you play so you won't start at 0% if you die in Excessive.

Clear type will affect your Volforce. Excessive is harder so it is worth more Volforce. 

Excessive + ARS is not available on light start. This does not matter if you play Konasute. In general, you should always play with Excessive + ARS if you have the option. 

### Volume
<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-3">
![audiolevels](/startingout/audiolevels.png)
</div>

This is Volume. If you are playing on Konasute, this will be the game
volume (like in the screenshot). If you are at an arcade, this will be headset
volume. If you don't have a headset plugged in at the arcade this will do
nothing. 

### Challenge Options
<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-3">
![challenge](/startingout/challenge.png)
</div>

These are the challenge options. During a run if you fall below the
point to get the grade that you have selected you will automatically fail out.
For example if I selected UC and I missed a note, it would auto fail me out. 

## Additional things to note

Most of these settings are completely preference. There are general recommended settings but nothing is concrete. Try out things and see if you like them. 

Valkyrie Cabinets have more settings than Konasute and Nemsys cabs. While Konasute has most of them, there are some Valkyrie-exclusive features.
