# KSM Controller Setup

This guide was originally intended for FAUCETWO controllers, but it should work for YuanCon's SDVX 12 and SDVX LITE 3 as they also have an eAcloud mode.

## Step 0
Before opening KSM, make sure your controller is in **eAcloud mode**:
  - For FAUCETWO/FAUCETWO+, hold down `START + BT-A + FX-L + FX-R` until all lights flash
  - For YuanCon SDVX 12 and SDVX LITE 3, unplug the controller and then while holding down `BT-C`, plug in the controller and wait until all lights flash. If this does not work, repeat the process but try holding down `START + BT-C` instead.

## Step 1
Open KSM and enter `OPTION`

## Step 5
This page must be navigated with your keyboard's arrow keys. Navigate to the bottom and change pages until you reach `Gamepad 1`. For each button on this page:
  1. Select it with your arrow keys
  2. Press `Enter` to change the current binding
  3. Press the corresponding button on your controller

Once you are done, press `ESC` a few times to return to the title screen and you are ready to play!
